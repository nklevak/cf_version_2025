    <h1>Research Study Participation Information</h1>

    <p class="section-title">DESCRIPTION:</p>
    <p>You are invited to participate in a research study that aims to understand human decision making, executive control (the management and coordination of cognitive processes), learning, and memory. We hope to learn more about the brain and cognitive mechanisms that support these cognitive abilities. As a young, healthy volunteer, you have been asked to participate in this study because our objective is to understand the cognitive functions supported by the healthy human brain.</p>
    <p>You will be asked to verify that you are between 18-50 years of age. You will be asked to attend to stimuli presented from a computer and then make a manual response based upon the stimuli.</p>

    <p>You will be asked to make responses in one or more of the following conditions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Respond based upon your preferences between different presented options.</li>
        <li>Respond as quickly and accurately as possible to stimuli that are presented in succession.</li>
        <li>Learn a set of stimuli and later respond based upon your memory of the stimuli that you learned.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You may also be asked to fill out some questionnaires or surveys during the experiment.</p>
    <p>As your participation in the experiment is voluntary, you are free to discontinue the experiment at any point.</p>
    <p>At the discretion of the protocol director, subjects may be taken out of this study due to unanticipated circumstances. Some possible reasons for withdrawal are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Failure to follow instructions</li>
        <li>The investigator decides that continuation would be harmful to you</li>
        <li>The study is canceled</li>
        <li>Not meeting inclusion criteria</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="section-title">TIME INVOLVEMENT:</p>
    <p>Your participation in this experiment will take approximately 15 minutes â€“ 20 hours. Longer studies will be broken up across multiple study sessions. The specific length of the study that you will be completing will be in your study description.</p>

    <p class="section-title">RISKS AND BENEFITS:</p>
    <p>There are no known risks associated with participation in this study. We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any benefits from this study.</p>

    <p class="section-title">PAYMENTS:</p>
    <p>As compensation for your participation, you will be paid $12/hour at the end of the testing session. There is no cost to you for this study. There may be the potential to earn bonus pay based upon performance, or completion of the entire group of tasks.</p>
