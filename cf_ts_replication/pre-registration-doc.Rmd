## Introduction

This is the pre-registration for an experiment based off of our previous pilot study ("the Effect of Task Switching on Cognitive Fatigue") which was presented at the Computational Cognitive Neuroscience Conference in 2025.

In this previous experiment, as described in the aforementioned CCN extended abstract, "we developed a novel paradigm using an objective measure of cognitive fatigue-—participants’ willingness to spend money on rest following periods of cognitive exertion. Across the experiment, epochs characterized by poor performance (“low-efficacy”) were followed by significantly increased cognitive fatigue. This effect was potentiated when subjects anticipated an upcoming task switch. Crucially, the impact of undergoing a task switch on subsequent performance also depended on prior task efficacy: switching into a new task improved performance after low-efficacy epochs but impaired it after high-efficacy epochs. These results use an objective measure to replicate prior findings that cognitive fatigue worsens after low-efficacy tasks. Further, they demonstrate an intriguing role for task-switching in cognitive fatigue. Task-switching is costly to performance only during high-efficacy periods; in low-efficacy periods, undergoing a switch enhances performance. Given the relationship between performance and cognitive fatigue, this also suggests that switching into a new task while in a low-efficacy state improves fatigue."

In this new experiment, we will use the same methodology as we did before with minor changes--primarily with stimuli presentation length. Our questions of interest are:
1) Is there a post-error increase in fatigue? i.e. is accuracy a significant negative estimator for subsequent rest time when accounting for subject differences.
2) When does task switching improve performance, if ever? i.e. how does performance differ in the epoch following a switch vs a non-switch.
3) Is task switching acted upon as rejuvenating? i.e. will rest time when cued that the next epoch will be a switch be less than when cued the next epoch will be a stay
4) [exploratory/new] Is there a clear relationship between rest time in a given SPR and following performance?

We hypothesize that 
1) there will be a consistent post-error increase in fatigue, where participants will rest for longer after lower-performance epochs.
2) task switching will improve performance when participants were performing more poorly in the prior epoch, while it will hurt performance when they were performing relatively well in the previous epoch.
3) rest time after participants are cued of an upcoming switch will be longer than when they are cued of an upcoming task stay.
4) rest time is rejuvenating in the short term (????)

Through running this study, we hope to better understand and clarify the role that task switching plays in cognitive fatigue and performance. Additionally, we hope to validate self-paced rests as a novel method of measuring fatigue.

## Methods

### Power Analysis

Using G*Power, the effect sizes for our hypotheses from our last study, an alpha of 0.05, and aiming for a power value of at least 80% we got this sample size for each of our first three hypotheses:

1) previous effect size for the post-error fatigue increase finding was small (std beta of 0.06), so we put 0.02 as the desired effect size (rounding up to a small effect size). Using the linear multiple regression statistical test type, this gave us a sample size of 311. (This is an approximation due to the complexity of our mixed-effects structure which G*Power does not account for). For the simple linear regression model where we do not account for subject differences or other predictors, we had an effect size of 0.03 which would yield a sample size of 208.

2) For the effect of task switching x prior performance on future performance, we previously for an effect size of 0.6724 (std beta of 0.82) so we put that as the desired effect size. Using the linear multiple regression statistical test type, this gave us a sample size of 12 (This is an approximation due to the complexity of our mixed-effects structure which G*Power does not account for).

3) previous effect size for the effect of the switch cue on rest length was small (std. beta of 0.08), so we put 0.02 as the desired effect size (rounding up to a small effect size). Using the linear multiple regression statistical test type, this gave us a sample size of 311. (This is an approximation due to the complexity of our mixed-effects structure which G*Power does not account for).

While these results are simplified due to G*Power's limitations, we took this and resources into account when deciding to use a sample of 150 people.

### Planned Sample

The planned sample size is __ participants on prolific. They will be sampled on prolific continuously until __ participants take the study (should i say until that many remain post-exclusion???). The sampling demographics will be the demographics of Prolific, but it is unclear what exactly they will be. 

The pre-selection criteria are:
- Participants have to be fluent in English.
- Participants need to select that they have no issues seeing colors.
- Participants have to have an approval rate of 99-100

### Task Design	

With some changes, this methods description is taken from the CCN extended abstract linked above: 

We developed a novel paradigm to be conducted online on Prolific for approximately 55 minutes. After an instructional period, participants are taken through a training phase of three "games": a spatial recall game (memorizing 4 squares flashing on a 4x4 grid), a digit span game (memorizing 4 digits flashing on screen), and a low effort rest game (clicking the digit corresponding to a given shape, with no memory required). These training phases were 4 trials per game.

The spatial recall and digit span games are referred to as Game A and Game B (counterbalanced across participants). In the main phase after training, participants are shown 10 blocks of the games in the order: ABABBABAAB. Each block consists of 3 epochs (10 trials of a given task per epoch) of the same game, and every epoch was followed by a self-paced rest (SPR) period (described below in more detail). Here, each SPR period is preceded by a cue that signals whether, in the following epoch, participants would be playing the same game (a task stay) or a different game (a task switch). 

Importantly, this experiment incorporates the aforementioned SPR periods, each consisting of 20 1.525 second trials of the low effort rest game. Participants could terminate SPR periods at their discretion. Following the conclusion of the 10 blocks, participants finish the rest trials they had skipped to equalize the length of the experiment. Crucially, the decision to remain in rest is costly. Participants are told they will lose points from an initial 600 point endowment for every trial they remained in rest, and that the total points remaining after task completion would be used to calculate a monetary bonus ($2). Thus, in contrast to prior work which has relied primarily on subjective (self-reported) fatigue, rest duration–-indexing participants' willingness to incur a cost to continue resting—-is used here as an objective measure of cognitive fatigue.

Here are more details about the timings for the spatial recall task and the digit span task:
digit span:
    Sequence Presentation: 1.9 seconds (4 digits × (275ms display + 200ms gap between digits))
    Response Window: 4.2 seconds maximum
    total per trial: 6.1 seconds max
spatial recall:
    initial stimulus (empty grid): 100 ms
    Sequence Presentation: 2.06 seconds (4 squares × (315ms display + 200ms gap))
    Response Window: 4.2 seconds maximum
    total per trial: 6.36 seconds max
self paced rest:
    total per trial: 1.525 seconds (1350ms display + 175ms clear screen)
*In the training phase, each trial of each game (and the rest task) was followed by a 1s feedback period.*
